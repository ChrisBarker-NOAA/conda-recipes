conda-recipes for IOOS packages

For anaconda users, it's nice to be able to do "conda install" instead of "pip install".
Conda creates the environment needed before running any code to do the actual build.

We should still keep posting your stuff on pypi, of course. But if we distribute stuff on binstar also, then conda users can do "conda install" and be sure that everything plays nice with their conda environment.
